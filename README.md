# Quantum-corrleation-phase-gradient-microscopy

Code must be run on Labview 2020 or later. Main program is "Wavefront analysis Final.vi". 

Sample data is too large to be uploaded on github, please contact authors to request the data files

All program settings are optimized for the sample data.

- Centroid shift bound - Centroid shift cut off in pixels. Noise can sometimes result in very large centroid shifts
- Magnification - magnification of microscope system
- focal length - focal length of lens before camera in meters
- Beam diameter - Beam diameter on sample plane in millimeters
- Subtract background - whether background subtraction is performed
- Signal (Near Field) ROI - setting the region of interest in the signal beam in pixels
